# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  
  The Gaming Room is a fictional client for Creative Technology Solutions(CTS). The Gaming Room wants to expand their game "Draw It or Lose It" to multiple platforms using various software patterns in a distributed environment(Linux, Mac, and Windows), as well as mobile platforms. The client wanted to create a web-based application with a server-style configuration for hosting the website and allowing it to scale up to thousands of players. 
  
# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

  I don't think I did anything particularly well, however I now understand that software development is not as simple as just starting a project one day. An incredible amount of planning and research is required before any actual development can begin.
  
# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

  Working through the design document gave me a good understanding of the acceptable criteria when developing the code. 

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  I would revise the development requirements. I would read more into networking and how servers work and communicate on specific operating systems before making another recommendation.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  The user's needs are mostly under the "Design Constraints" section of the software design document. Ultimately, the user's needs are what make a quality product. If the user needs are not met then the product will not perform well.

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

  This was my first time actually "designing" software. The design template that was provided was a good start in touching the general areas of software design.
